# Tic-Tac-Toe

A simple web application to play a two-player [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe,) game similar to (but simpler than) [http://playtictactoe.org/](http://playtictactoe.org/).

Tic-Tac-Toe is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in an n-by-n grid (usually 3-by-3). The player who succeeds in placing n of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
